# EV Charging Station Analysis in Canada

### **Objective**
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) charging station data in Canada using the dataset provided by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan).

The goal is to:
1. Explore and clean the data.
2. Analyze the distribution of charging stations across regions.
3. Identify trends in station growth over time.
4. Visualize the charging station network using maps and charts.

### **Key Findings**
- **Growth Trends**: A significant rise in EV charging stations since 2019, reflecting increased adoption of electric vehicles.
- **Regional Insights**: Provinces like Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia lead in both Level 2 and DC fast charging infrastructure.
- **Connector Types**: The J1772 connector dominates the charging network, followed by CHAdeMO and CCS connectors.
- **Top Charging Networks**: Flo, Tesla, and Circuit électrique dominate the Canadian EV market.
